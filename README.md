For Godot 4

The Rotor is a node making its child rotate with different useful properties. Like keeping the child's rotation, rotating back and forth between 2 angles and more.

It comes with a showcase scene where you can see all the properties in action.

Features include:

 1. Keeping the child's rotation when the parent rotates.
 2. Rotations can be 360Â° but also more/less
 3. Once it rotates the amount you choose, it can either loop back from the start or start rotating backward.
 4. Choose the number of rotations.
 5. You can enable the Rotor's effect on nodes that aren't its children or disable it on some of its children.
 6. Can flip (horizontal/vertical) nodes past a certain angle.
 7. Rotation can be standard or using tweens
